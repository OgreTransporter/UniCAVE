A general update – the UniCAVE group is continuing to work on things behind the scenes, even though there haven’t been a huge number of commits, etc. lately. We are nearing the workings of a solution for Unity’s newer VideoPlayer component such that video will sync across CAVEs and other immersive display systems. In addition, we are working through a warp + blend solution that is nearing a working example case here at our lab. Both of these things will most likely be pushed to the repo in the future, with the VideoPlayer adjustments sooner. We also wanted to say a general thanks for the interest and questions we continue to receive about the project.
