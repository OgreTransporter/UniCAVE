title: 2019 Update
---

Dear UniCAVE community,

The unfortunate news is Unity once again is updating their networking system. This has caused NetworkBehaviour and some other classes / functions that UniCAVE uses to become obsolete. We are looking into trying to fix this to support UniCAVE on clustered based systems. In the mean time, we are going to be posting a 2019 version soon that at least works with multiple monitors / displays on a single system. This will be added in a separate directory or branch.
