So it appears that at or around version 2019.1.9, the Networking code in Unity that had been changed to Obsolete, is back to just Deprecated. This is good news as the prior networking scripts now still work. We are considering adopting the open source [“Mirror” Unity plugin](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/mirror-129321) if necessary depending on the outcome of Unity’s networking changes.
