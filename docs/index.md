## Description

The UniCAVE project aims to build a plugin for [Unity3D](https://unity3d.com) that provides support for CAVE environments utilizing features built into the engine.  This approach enables a user to configure their system entirely in the Unity3D editor providing a simplified method for supporting adapting existing Unity projects for distributed visualization platforms.

The concept for the plugin is to have a three step approach for integration:
